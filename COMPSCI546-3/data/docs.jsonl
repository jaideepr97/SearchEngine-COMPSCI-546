Walt Whitman \u2014 the first personality featured in the exhibition, which calls him \u201cthe guiding light of American bohemia\u201d \u2014 published \u201cLeaves of Grass\u201d in 1855; in 1844, Alexandre Dumas began serializing \u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo,\u201d in which a self-made working-class young man assumes an aristocratic name and character to exact revenge on his enemies.

One particularly evocative juxtaposition places a reprint of a 1966 photograph of Muhammad Ali with his fist thrust directly into the camera lens next to a 1971 image of Clint Eastwood, holding an enormous handgun in a visually analogous confrontation with the viewer.

Perhaps the most telling image is a photograph of skateboarder Tony Hawk, doing a move in his kitchen. His young son sits at the kitchen counter while his wife cradles a baby. The dishwasher is open, there are decorative plates above the standard-issue wooden cupboards and the whole thing screams suburbia. The wall text notes his success as an entrepreneur, with a popular line of sports equipment and a video game series.

Susan Sontag definitely seems a worthy inclusion, but are there no classical musicians, ballet dancers or post-structuralist philosophers who are cool? Was the great violinist Jascha Heifetz cool?
